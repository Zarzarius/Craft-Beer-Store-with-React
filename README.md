# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

EXERCISE

# SPA-React-12-Ecommerce-site

# Create an ecommerce App.

The App should have a login screen. If the user has not been validated show the errors on the fields.
The user name if validated should appear in the header at all times.

If the user has been validated take the user to the products page. A link to the products page also has to be on the header.

From the products page the user can select a product to add to the cart. There should be a link to the cart on the header.

On the cart page, the user can increment or decrement the amount of the specific product. The product can also be removed from the cart. This can also occur if the amount on order goes below 1.

From the products page we can also click on the product to see further details.

There should also be a checkout link on the header that takes the user to the checkout page.

On the checkout page the user should be able to see a list of all their orders with the individual prices and amounts. Plus total price per line.

There should be a total price at the bottom of the list. This should include shipping . The shipping value you can decide on. Whether it's a global price
added to the final order or a shipping price per product. Entirely your choice.

There should be a button on this page to place the order. This should inform the user in whichever way you decide that an order has been placed. Possibly an alert or another component that says ty for placing this order with us etc etc.

Or

You can also code something similar to what I did with the blogs site. Your choice. I will be coding over the weekend, time permiting this ecommerce exercise :)

Good luck and enjoy!
